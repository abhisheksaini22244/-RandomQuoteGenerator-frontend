The Random Quote Generator project is a beginner-level project that involves creating a web page that displays random quotes to the user when they click a button. The project typically uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple, yet functional application.

The main idea behind this project is to use JavaScript to randomly select a quote from an array of quotes and display it on the web page. The project also involves creating a button that, when clicked, triggers the JavaScript function to display a new quote.

The project typically involves the following steps:

Create an HTML file that includes the necessary elements for the web page, such as a header, a container for the quote, and a button to trigger the JavaScript function.

Use CSS to style the HTML elements and make the web page visually appealing.

Create a JavaScript file that includes an array of quotes and a function to randomly select a quote from the array.

Add an event listener to the button element in the HTML file that triggers the JavaScript function to display a new quote when the button is clicked.
